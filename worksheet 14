  # Create caption ----
  # The output$caption is computed based on a reactive expression
  # that returns input$caption. When the user changes the
  # "caption" field:
  #
  # 1. This function is automatically called to recompute the output
  # 2. New caption is pushed back to the browser for re-display

  # below don't depend on input$caption, those expressions are
  # NOT called when input$caption changes

  # Generate a summary of the dataset ----

  # expression, so will be re-executed whenever datasetInput is
  # invalidated, i.e. whenever the input$dataset changes

    dataset <- datasetInput()

  # Show the first "n" observations ----
  # The output$view depends on both the databaseInput reactive
  # expression and input$obs, so it will be re-executed whenever
  # input$dataset or input$obs is changed
